## 🚨 REMAINING ISSUES (Round 3)

### Consensus Issues (flagged by 3+ personas):

#### #1: Origin Story Needs More Visceral Emotion (4/6)
**Who:** Soo-jin, Kai, Rachel, Alex
**Problem:** "Got tired of culling by hand" is rational but not *felt*. Missing the emotional cost.
**Suggestion (Kai):** "We shoot 10,000+ frames per session. Culling by hand took 8+ hours per shoot — more time sorting than shooting."
**Effort:** Low (copy tweak)

#### #2: Scoring Criteria Inconsistency (3/6)
**Who:** David (critical), Marcus, Rachel
**Problem:** Showcase says 3 criteria (Sharpness · Exposure · Composition). Features says 5 (+ noise, face quality). Which is it?
**Fix:** Unify across all sections or clarify "primary" vs "extended" criteria.
**Effort:** Low (copy alignment)

#### #3: No Intel Mac Benchmark (3/6)
**Who:** David, Rachel, Marcus
**Problem:** "~90 sec / 10K" only qualified for Apple Silicon. Intel users don't know their performance.
**Fix:** Add "~4 min on Intel" or similar approximation.
**Effort:** Low (copy addition)

#### #4: No Social Proof (4/6)
**Who:** Alex, Soo-jin, Kai, Rachel
**Problem:** No reviews, beta user count, or testimonials. "Built by photographers" is good but "Used by 500+ photographers" is better.
**Fix:** Add beta user count or placeholder for launch-day social proof.
**Effort:** Low (copy addition)

#### #5: No Demo Video (3/6)
**Who:** Alex, Rachel, David
**Problem:** Text-only hero. A 15-second video of clustering → ranking → export would push conversion significantly.
**Fix:** Record demo video or GIF.
**Effort:** High (production)

### Individual Issues (flagged by 1-2 personas):

| Issue | Persona | Severity |
|-------|---------|----------|
| XMP sidecar format spec missing | Marcus, David | Medium |
| LR Classic version compatibility | Marcus, David | Medium |
| "Hard links" confusing for non-technical | David | Low |
| Beta timeline unclear ("Free during beta" — when does it end?) | Rachel | Medium |
| Aftershoot comparison one-sided (doesn't acknowledge strengths) | Rachel | Low |
| Keyboard shortcuts vs PM exact match unclear | Marcus, David | Low |
| No network call transparency (license check, telemetry) | David | Low |

| FAQ | 9/10 ✅ | 8/10 ✅ | 8/10 ✅ | 8/10 ✅ | 9/10 ✅ | 8/10 ✅ | **STRONGEST** |
| CTA | 9/10 ✅ | 9/10 ✅ | 9/10 ✅ | 8/10 ✅ | 9/10 ✅ | 9/10 ✅ | **STRONGEST** |

**Strongest sections:** CTA (earned, emotional), FAQ (peer-to-peer voice), Hero (clear + credible)
**No weak sections remaining.** Gallery was weakest in R2 — now STRONG after rewrite.
