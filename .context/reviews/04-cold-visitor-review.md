# BurstPick Landing Page Review
**Reviewer**: Alex (Cold Visitor)  
**Date**: 2026-02-18  
**Search Query**: "best app to sort burst photos mac"  
**Context**: 29-year-old UX researcher, serious hobbyist bird photographer (Sony A7RV), produces ~2,000 photos per outing, has never heard of BurstPick or "burst culling"

---

## 3-Second Verdict

**What I understood**: An AI app that automatically sorts and ranks burst photos on your Mac.

**Who I think this is for**: Photographers who shoot a lot of similar photos in quick succession and need help picking the best ones.

**Trust level**: 3/5 — The tagline mentions "built by photographers" which is good, but I don't see any faces, names, or proof yet. Could be marketing speak.

**Would I scroll?**: Yes — because the headline directly addresses my pain point (I literally just searched for this), and the description mentions "10,000+ frames per session" which matches my workflow exactly. The promise of "seconds, not hours" is compelling enough to keep reading.

## 8-Second Verdict

**The hook**: The hero section nails it. "We shoot 10,000+ frames per session and got tired of culling by hand" — that's *me*. The specific mention of "sharpness, exposure, and composition" shows they understand what matters. The phrase "You make the final call" is reassuring (I'm not handing over control to a black box).

**Confusion points**: 
- What does "clusters your burst sequences" mean exactly? I understand the concept now, but on first read, "clustering" felt like jargon. 
- The phrase "surfaces your best candidates" is clear enough, but I'm still not 100% sure what the actual workflow looks like. Do I drag photos in? Do I click a button? How long does it take?
- No mention of cost yet (though I see "free during beta" later). That's a relief, but I'd want to know the final price before committing.

**"By photographers" signal**: Visible and strong. The hero section explicitly says "We shoot 10,000+ frames per session and got tired of culling by hand." This feels authentic, not corporate.

## First Scroll Verdict

**One thing I'll remember**: "Clusters, scores, and ranks them — surfacing your strongest candidates in seconds, not hours." This is the core promise, and it's sticky. I can picture myself opening BurstPick after a shoot and having my best shots pre-sorted.

**Would I download?**: Yes — because:
1. It solves a real problem I have (manual burst culling takes forever)
2. It's non-destructive (my photos are safe)
3. It's local (no uploading to the cloud, which I'm paranoid about)
4. It integrates with Lightroom (my existing workflow)
5. It's free to try during beta

**What would change my mind**: Nothing major, but I'd want to see:
- A video or GIF showing the actual interface in action (the "See BurstPick in Action" section has screenshots, but they're technical and don't show the speed/ease)
- A clearer before/after visual (the "From Thousands to Your Top Candidates" section helps, but it's text-heavy)
- Pricing for after beta (I see "one-time purchase" mentioned, but not the actual number)

## Section-by-Section Clarity Score

| Section | Clarity | Notes |
|---------|---------|-------|
| **Hero (Tagline + Description)** | Clear | "AI-powered burst photo culling, built by photographers" is immediately understandable. The description is specific and addresses my exact use case. |
| **Showcase ("Built by Photographers, for Photographers")** | Clear | The stats (Sharpness · Exposure · Composition, 26+ RAW Formats, 100% Local App) are relevant and reassuring. The narrative about "wildlife action sequences, indoor sports at 30fps" makes me feel seen. |
| **Story ("From Thousands to Your Top Candidates")** | Confusing | The before/after framing is good, but the text is vague. "Hundreds of near-identical burst shots" — how many is "hundreds"? I shoot 2,000+ per outing. Does it handle that? The "after" description is just a list of criteria, not a visual proof. |
| **Features ("Why BurstPick?")** | Confusing | Too many features listed (8 total). I don't care about "Face Detection & Grouping" or "Keyboard-Driven Workflow" on first read — I just want to know if it'll save me time. The feature descriptions are clear individually, but collectively they feel like feature bloat. "Intelligent Clustering" and "Multi-Model ML Scoring" are the only ones that matter to me. |
| **Gallery ("See BurstPick in Action")** | Confusing | The screenshots are too technical. "NavigationSplitView with clusters sidebar, detail view, and filmstrip" — I don't know what that means. I want to see a real workflow: import → cluster → rank → export. The descriptions read like developer notes, not user-facing copy. |
| **FAQ** | Clear | This section is excellent. Q1 (formats), Q4 (no internet), Q6 (won't delete photos), Q7 (Lightroom integration), Q9 (workflow fit) directly address my concerns. Q8 ("Who built BurstPick?") is good but could be more personal (a name, a photo, a story). |
| **CTA ("Get back to shooting, not sorting")** | Clear | The headline is perfect. The copy reinforces the key differentiators (one-time purchase, no subscription, no cloud, local processing). The button is clear. |
| **Footer** | Clear | "Burst photo culling, built by photographers who shoot 10K+ frames a day" — reinforces the brand promise. The tech stack (Swift, SwiftUI, Vision, CoreML) is a nice touch for credibility. |

## Rewrite Suggestion for Hero

If I landed from Google, here's what I'd want to see:

**Current**:
> "AI-powered burst photo culling, built by photographers. We shoot 10,000+ frames per session and got tired of culling by hand. So we built BurstPick — on-device AI that clusters your burst sequences, ranks them by sharpness, exposure, and composition, and surfaces your best candidates. You make the final call."

**Suggested**:
> "Cull 2,000 burst photos in minutes, not hours.
>
> BurstPick uses AI to automatically group your near-identical shots, rank them by sharpness and composition, and show you the best ones first. Built by photographers who shoot wildlife and sports — we know the pain of manual culling.
>
> Everything stays on your Mac. Your photos are never modified. Try free."

**Why this works**:
1. **Lead with the benefit** ("Cull 2,000 burst photos in minutes, not hours") — this is what I searched for
2. **Explain the workflow in plain English** ("group → rank → show best") — no jargon
3. **Prove credibility** ("Built by photographers who shoot wildlife and sports") — specific, not generic
4. **Address my fear** ("Your photos are never modified") — this is huge for photographers
5. **Lower friction** ("Try free") — removes the risk of downloading

## Overall Impression

**Strengths**:
- The landing page understands the target audience deeply (burst-heavy workflows, Lightroom integration, non-destructive operations)
- The "built by photographers" narrative is authentic and visible throughout
- The FAQ section is comprehensive and addresses real concerns (privacy, cost, compatibility)
- The copy is specific and verifiable (20+ ML models, 26+ RAW formats, 100% local)
- The value proposition is clear: save time on culling, keep your workflow intact

**Weaknesses**:
- The hero section uses some jargon ("clustering," "embeddings") that could be simplified
- The "See BurstPick in Action" gallery is too technical and doesn't show the actual user experience
- The features section is overwhelming (8 features is too many for a first-time visitor)
- No visual proof of speed (no video, no GIF, no animation showing the before/after)
- The founder/team story is mentioned but not personalized (no names, no photos, no "why I built this" narrative)

**Verdict**: This landing page is **above average** for a cold visitor. It directly addresses my search query, proves it understands my workflow, and removes my biggest fears (data loss, cloud uploads, subscription fees). I would download and try it. However, it could be more compelling with a video demo and a more personal founder story.

**Likelihood of download**: 75% (I'd download immediately if there was a 30-second video showing the clustering and ranking in action)
