# BurstPick Landing Page Review
**Reviewer**: Rachel (Wedding/Event/Sports Photographer)  
**Date**: 2026-02-18  
**Current Tools**: Photo Mechanic 6 + Lightroom Classic + Narrative Select  
**Tried**: Aftershoot (3 months, 2025)

---

## Competitive Clarity Score: 4/5

**Why not 5?** The page nails the "companion not replacement" positioning and clearly differentiates from Aftershoot. But it could be more explicit about Photo Mechanic integration earlier in the hero section. The workflow fit is clear by FAQ #9, but a photographer scrolling fast might miss it.

**What works**: The FAQ directly addresses my three biggest questions (Aftershoot comparison, Lightroom integration, workflow fit). The hero copy "You make the final call" is anti-Aftershoot messaging that speaks directly to my pain. The "Built by Photographers" section feels genuine because it names the specific workflows (wildlife action, 30fps sports, event coverage) that match my reality.

**What's missing**: No explicit mention of Photo Mechanic in the hero or features section. I had to scroll to FAQ #9 to confirm it works *alongside* PM, not as a replacement. For someone like me who's invested 10+ years in PM's ingest workflow, that's a critical question that should be answered in the first 10 seconds.

## Head-to-Head Assessment

### vs Aftershoot
**Wins:**
- **Transparency**: "You see exactly why each photo was ranked" (FAQ #10) directly addresses my biggest Aftershoot complaint. I don't see the *how* on the landing page (no scoring breakdown UI shown), but the promise is there.
- **Local-first**: "100% Local App" + "No photos ever leave your Mac" is repeated 4 times. This is the right frequency for someone burned by cloud-dependent tools.
- **One-time purchase**: "$89 one-time" vs Aftershoot's subscription model. For my $500/yr budget, this is a real win.
- **Purpose-built for bursts**: "Burst sequences" language throughout. Aftershoot feels like a general culling tool; BurstPick feels specialized.

**Loses:**
- **Maturity/polish**: Aftershoot has 3+ years of refinement. BurstPick is newer. The page doesn't address this risk directly (though "free beta" helps).
- **Integration depth**: Aftershoot is a Lightroom plugin. BurstPick requires export/import workflow. The page frames this as a feature ("companion not replacement") but it's still a friction point vs Aftershoot's seamless LR integration.

**Verdict**: The page wins on transparency and local-first, but doesn't fully address the workflow friction vs Aftershoot's plugin model. A photographer who liked Aftershoot's speed might not see why they'd add another step.

---

### vs Photo Mechanic
**Wins:**
- **ML ranking**: "20+ ML models analyze sharpness, exposure, noise, aesthetics, and face quality." PM has zero intelligence here. This is the real value prop.
- **Clustering**: "Automatically groups burst sequences using image embeddings and temporal proximity." PM can't do this. This is genuinely new.
- **Face grouping**: "Detects faces and groups them by person across your entire shoot." PM has no face awareness.

**Loses:**
- **Ingest speed**: The page doesn't mention ingest speed at all. PM ingests 10K+ photos/sec. BurstPick's speed is unknown. For someone who shoots 8,000 RAW per wedding, this matters.
- **Keyboard shortcuts**: The page mentions "K to keep, R to reject" but doesn't say if these match PM's shortcuts. PM users have muscle memory. The page should say "Same shortcuts you already know" if true, or explain the learning curve if not.
- **RAW support breadth**: BurstPick supports 26+ RAW formats; PM supports more. Not a real loss, but worth noting.

**Verdict**: The page clearly positions BurstPick as a *companion* to PM (FAQ #9 is explicit: "Ingest with Photo Mechanic, pre-cull with BurstPick, edit in Lightroom"). This is the right positioning. But it should lead with this in the hero, not bury it in FAQ.

---

### vs Lightroom
**Wins:**
- **Purpose-built for culling**: Lightroom's Survey mode is slow with 50+ similar frames. BurstPick's clustering + ranking is faster for burst-heavy workflows.
- **Non-destructive**: "Keep/Reject decisions, star ratings, and color labels with autosave. Nothing is ever deleted." Lightroom does this too, but BurstPick's clustering makes it faster.

**Loses:**
- **Ecosystem lock-in**: Lightroom is the industry standard. The page doesn't position BurstPick as a threat to LR (good), but it also doesn't emphasize how deeply it integrates. "Export as XMP sidecars or directly to Lightroom Classic catalogs" is mentioned, but the page could show a screenshot of the export workflow.
- **Editing**: BurstPick doesn't edit. Lightroom does. The page is clear about this (companion positioning), but a photographer might wonder: "Why not just use LR's culling?"

**Verdict**: The companion positioning is clear and correct. The page doesn't oversell BurstPick as a Lightroom replacement, which is honest. But it could better explain *why* BurstPick's clustering is faster than LR's Survey mode for burst sequences.

## Switching Cost Assessment

### Learning Curve Signal
**Good:**
- Keyboard-driven workflow mentioned ("K to keep, R to reject, 1-5 for ratings, arrows to navigate").
- "Speed up your culling" suggests the interface is intuitive.

**Missing:**
- No comparison to Photo Mechanic or Lightroom shortcuts. Are these the same? Different? This is a switching cost question.
- No mention of onboarding or tutorials. For a $89 tool, I'd want to know if there's a learning curve.
- No mention of customizable shortcuts or preferences.

**Signal**: Moderate. The page assumes I'll figure it out, but doesn't reduce friction by saying "Same shortcuts you already know."

### Integration Clarity
**Good:**
- FAQ #9 is explicit: "Ingest with Photo Mechanic, pre-cull with BurstPick, edit in Lightroom."
- "Export decisions as XMP sidecars or directly to Lightroom Classic catalogs."
- "Non-destructive workflow" + "Nothing is ever deleted" addresses my XMP corruption fear.

**Missing:**
- No screenshot of the export workflow. How do I get my BurstPick ratings into Lightroom? Is it one click or five?
- No mention of what happens to my existing Lightroom catalog. Will BurstPick read my current ratings/flags?
- No mention of Photo Mechanic integration. Can BurstPick read PM's flags/ratings?

**Signal**: Good. The page answers the critical question (it works with LR), but doesn't show the workflow visually.

### Risk Mitigation
**Good:**
- "Never. BurstPick uses a non-destructive workflow. Export creates hard links to save disk space — your originals stay untouched." (FAQ #6)
- "No photos leave your device — ever." (repeated 4 times)
- "100% Local App" + "On-device processing" (showcase section)

**Missing:**
- No mention of backup/recovery. What if BurstPick crashes mid-cull?
- No mention of version compatibility. Will BurstPick's XMP exports work with future Lightroom versions?
- No mention of support/warranty. If something goes wrong, who do I contact?

**Signal**: Strong. The page emphasizes safety and non-destructive operations. This directly addresses my Aftershoot trauma (black-box decisions I couldn't undo).

## "By Photographers" Competitive Angle

**What the page says:**
- "Built by Photographers, for Photographers" (showcase heading)
- "We know the burst workflow because we live it — wildlife action sequences, indoor sports at 30fps, event coverage with thousands of frames."
- "BurstPick was born from that daily grind."
- FAQ #8: "BurstPick is built by a team of photographers and macOS engineers who shoot 10,000+ frames per session. We built it because we needed it — existing tools didn't understand burst-specific workflows."

**Does this create competitive advantage?**

Yes, but incompletely. The page says "we built it because we needed it," which is credible. But it doesn't say "we use Photo Mechanic and Lightroom daily" (which would be the killer line for me). 

The brand context says: *"Built by photographers who use Photo Mechanic and Lightroom daily"* — but this isn't on the landing page. This is a missed opportunity. If the page said "We use Photo Mechanic for ingest and Lightroom for editing, just like you. We built BurstPick to fill the gap between them," I'd trust it immediately.

**Verdict**: The "by photographers" angle is present but not weaponized. It should explicitly name the tools the team uses, not just the workflows.

## The 30-Second Verdict

**Would I add BurstPick to my workflow?**

**Yes, probably — but with hesitation.**

Here's what happens in my head in 30 seconds:

1. **Hero**: "AI-powered burst photo culling, built by photographers" — OK, sounds like Aftershoot. But "You make the final call" is different. Interesting.
2. **Showcase**: "Wildlife action sequences, indoor sports at 30fps" — Wait, that's me. They get it.
3. **Features**: "Intelligent Clustering" + "20+ ML models" — This is new. Photo Mechanic can't do this.
4. **Lightroom Integration**: "Export as XMP sidecars or directly to Lightroom Classic catalogs" — OK, it works with my workflow.
5. **Pricing**: "Free during beta" — I'll try it.

**But the hesitation:**
- I don't see how it fits into my Photo Mechanic ingest workflow until FAQ #9.
- I don't see a screenshot of the export workflow. Is it seamless or clunky?
- I don't know the learning curve. Will I spend 2 hours setting it up?
- I don't know if it's faster than Lightroom's Survey mode for my 8,000-photo weddings.

**The 30-second verdict**: "This looks promising. I'll download the beta and try it on my next wedding. But I'm not switching from Photo Mechanic + Lightroom unless it saves me 30+ minutes per shoot."

---

## What Would Make Me Switch (Top 3)

1. **"Same keyboard shortcuts you already know from Photo Mechanic"** — If K/R/U/P match PM, say it explicitly. This reduces switching cost by 50%.

2. **"See exactly why each photo was ranked — and override it in one click"** — The page promises transparency but doesn't show it. A screenshot of the scoring breakdown (e.g., "Sharpness: 9.2, Exposure: 8.1, Composition: 7.8") would prove the anti-Aftershoot angle.

3. **"Saves 30+ minutes per 10,000 photos vs Lightroom Survey mode"** — The page doesn't quantify the time savings. For a $89 tool, I need to know: How much faster is this than my current workflow? If it saves 30 minutes per wedding, that's $89 well spent. If it saves 5 minutes, it's not worth the learning curve.

## Scoring Breakdown

| Criterion | Score | Notes |
|-----------|-------|-------|
| **Clarity vs Aftershoot** | 5/5 | "You see exactly why each photo was ranked" + local-first + one-time purchase. Clear win. |
| **Clarity vs Photo Mechanic** | 3/5 | Companion positioning is clear (FAQ #9), but should be in hero. No mention of PM shortcuts. |
| **Clarity vs Lightroom** | 4/5 | Companion positioning is clear. XMP export is mentioned. Could show workflow screenshot. |
| **Workflow fit** | 4/5 | "Ingest with PM, pre-cull with BurstPick, edit in LR" is explicit. But buried in FAQ. |
| **Trust/Safety** | 5/5 | Non-destructive + local-first + "originals stay untouched" is repeated enough. |
| **Learning curve signal** | 3/5 | Keyboard shortcuts mentioned, but no comparison to PM. No onboarding info. |
| **Integration clarity** | 4/5 | XMP export is clear. Could show workflow screenshot. |
| **Risk mitigation** | 4/5 | Non-destructive + local-first is strong. Missing: crash recovery, version compatibility. |
| **"By photographers" angle** | 3/5 | Present but not weaponized. Should name Photo Mechanic + Lightroom explicitly. |
| **Time savings quantification** | 1/5 | Page doesn't say how much faster this is than current workflow. Critical gap. |

## Final Assessment

**Strengths:**
- ✅ Directly addresses Aftershoot's black-box problem
- ✅ Companion positioning is clear and honest
- ✅ Local-first + non-destructive is emphasized enough
- ✅ Specific workflows (wildlife, sports, events) build credibility
- ✅ FAQ #9 and #10 are excellent competitive positioning

**Weaknesses:**
- ❌ Photo Mechanic integration should be in hero, not FAQ
- ❌ No screenshot of scoring breakdown (transparency claim needs proof)
- ❌ No time savings quantification (critical for $89 decision)
- ❌ No mention of Photo Mechanic shortcuts (switching cost)
- ❌ "By photographers" angle doesn't name the tools the team uses

**Recommendation:**
The page is 80% there. It wins on transparency, local-first, and companion positioning. But it needs:
1. Hero mention of Photo Mechanic integration
2. Screenshot of scoring breakdown (to prove transparency)
3. Time savings claim (e.g., "30+ minutes faster per 10,000 photos")
4. Explicit mention of Photo Mechanic shortcuts or learning curve

With these changes, this page would convert me from "I'll try the beta" to "I'm buying this."

## Rachel's Confidence Level

**Would I recommend this to other wedding/sports photographers?**

Yes, with caveats:
- "Try the beta first. It's free and non-destructive."
- "It's not a replacement for Photo Mechanic or Lightroom. It's a middle step."
- "If you shoot 5,000+ RAW per session, this will save you time."
- "If you're happy with Lightroom's Survey mode, you might not need it."

**Would I pay $89 for it?**

Yes, if the beta proves it saves 30+ minutes per shoot. At my rate ($2,000/wedding), 30 minutes = $250 in billable time. $89 is a no-brainer.

**Would I switch from Aftershoot to BurstPick?**

Yes, immediately. Local-first + transparency + one-time purchase > cloud + black-box + subscription. The only reason I'd keep Aftershoot is if BurstPick is slower or less accurate. The page doesn't address speed or accuracy directly, which is a gap.
